## Introduction

This is the MVP of the application that will enable people who go to the gym to track their performance with a much better experience using NFC technology. For the MVP we are going to build a very simple backend-less app that will have the capability of scanning the NFC tag and opening the necessary webpage. In the future, this will become a cross-platform application for both Android and iOS. The name of the application is **GymPad**.

## App's Behavior

### Exercise screen

| Feature ID | Expected Behavior | What a User Should See |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1. Open singular exercise | Upon opening a link `https://gympad-e44fc.web.app/gymId="gymID"&equipmentId="equipmentId"`, the gym's data from the assets should be loaded: icon and a name; and the equipment data: name of the exercise performed on this equipment. +1 should be sent to a simple backend to increase the amount of users that entered the webapp. | An app bar with Gym's data on the left (icon and then name). The main screen should contain: a) title of the exercise taken from equipment, b) timer (mm:ss), c) weight horizontal scroller with increases of 2.5kg, default to 15kg, d) button 'Start Set'. |
| 2. Start Set | Upon pressing the 'Start Set', the timer should set off. The 'Start Set' button should switch to 'Stop Set'. | The color of the button, text on the button, and the timer going off |
| 3. Stop Set | Upon pressing 'Stop Set', timer should stop, and a new widget 'Reps' should appear | A modal window with title 'How many reps, champ?'; 2 buttons on the left '-2', '-1'; a main container with number of reps defaulting to 8; and 2 buttons on the right '+1', '+2'. Button on the bottom: 'Save'. |
| 4. Select reps | Pressing on '-2' button decreases the number in the main container by 2, and analogously with the other 3 buttons in the modal window | The number in the main container should change |
| 5. Saving the set | When 'Save' is pressed in the modal window, the modal window should close. | Modal window closes and a new table appears at the bottom of the page with columns: Set number, #reps, weight, time. The page becomes scrollable. Two buttons appear instead of 'Start Set'/'Stop Set': 'Start a new set' and 'Finish exercise'. |
| 6. Start a new set | Upon pressing 'Start a new set', same behavior as in feature 2. Timer resets. | Same view as in feature 2, but now with an extra table at the bottom. |
