            storage(hive) or if he decided to skip it. if he has answered or if he decided to skip -
            navigate to main screen. Otherwise - navigate to questionnaire page. Doesn't matter if
            the user is logged in or no - this should be the first screen he sees

            questionnaire is important and how it will help tailor the app experience to his needs.
            Say that it contains 12 questions including this one, and takes 3-5 minutes on average.
